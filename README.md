## Disaster Management System
#### Problem Statement
Helping people in evacuation and survival post disaster.
#### Background
A natural disaster leads to great loss of life and property. Many lives are lost just because of inefficient methods of evacuation and lack of awareness among the people. Although the government makes many efforts to provide relief to the people, they remain unaware of them as they are trapped in remote areas. If proper awareness is spread among the people then many lives can be saved.

#### Idea
We aim to create an app which provides the following features ->
 - **Use of online maps to guide people to National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) Camps :** The app will provide access to maps on which the currently active NDRF relief camps are marked and user can approach the nearest camps.
 - **Informing people of evacuation schedules and locations :** The app shows the plans for the evacuation so that people who are nearby can approach the location, thus smoothening the work of NDRF.
 - **Providing them General Guidelines like First Aid and Survival Methodology :** For the people trapped in remote areas where it takes time for the help to reach, the app provides basic guidelines which they need for basic survival.
 - **Detecting nearest mobile phones through GPS :** Using the app people can find each other and form small groups helping each other and making evacuation relatively easier.
 - **Immediate evacuations :** In the app, there would be an option of request for immediate evacuations which can be used in medical emergencies.
 - **Warning about dangerous routes :** The maps warn them about the dangerous routes and show them safest routes available to reach the camps. 
 - **Relief Fund :** The app would allow interested people to help in every possible way they can. People who are far away can help economically and the people nearby can volunteer by helping the victims physically.
